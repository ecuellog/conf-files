# Touchscreen Auto Enable/Disable

- Copy `lid.sh` into `/etc/acpi`.
- Copy `lm_lid` into `/etc/acpi/events`.
- Run `lid.sh` in last line of `/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc`. Example in `xinitrc`.

**Note:** These scripts are only valid for my current system (ASUS laptop). Touchscreen device name may be different for other systems or other aspects of these scripts may not work.
